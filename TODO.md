- boosting missing measurements, try to solve the issue of missing probability mass in the distributions
-- Probe 1: estimate missing probability mass during prediction -> maybe slow
-- Probe 2: create a complete probability distribution and precomute missing values -> maybe lots of memory needed
-- each Probe is a branch
